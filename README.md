## What is it?

This is a ZSH plugin that enables you to use OpenAI's powerful AI in the command line. OpenAI is the AI that also powers GitHub Copilot.


## How do I install it?
### Manual Installation
1. Install the OpenAI package.
```
pip3 install openai
```

2. Download the ZSH plugin.

```
git clone https://github.com/alexclaz/zsh_openai.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh_openai
```

3. Add the following to your `.zshrc` file.

Using oh-my-zsh:
```
    plugins=(zsh_openai)
    bindkey '^X' create_completion
```
Without oh-my-zsh:
```
    # in your/custom/path you need to have a "plugins" folder and in there you clone the repository as zsh_openai
    export ZSH_CUSTOM="your/custom/path"
    source "$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh_openai/zsh_openai.plugin.zsh"
    bindkey '^X' create_completion
```

4. Create a file called `openaiapirc` in `~/.config` with your ORGANIZATION_ID and SECRET_KEY.

```
[openai]
organization_id = ...
secret_key = ...
```

5. Run `zsh`, start typing and complete it using `^X`!
